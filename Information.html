<h1 style="color:limegreen;" style="font-size: 225px ;" style="font-family:serif ;">Hi! Welcome and get ready to learn how I got the inspiration to build the website.</h1>



<h2>well one day i looked up into the sky and thought well shit.</h2>
<h2>the school im going to is taking away the thing we love.</h2>
<h2>Discord is the best way for people around the world to talk into.</h2>
<h2>well why does the school take it from us?</h2>
<h2>Because they dont want any of us to have fun.</h2>
<h2>they removed our right to talk to our friends.</h2>
<h2>i created this website for you people. not for me for you.</h2>
<h2>i want everyone to enjoy talking to eachother without moderation from schools!</h2>
<h2>I will be admin to this site and i will monitor it for any actives from the school.</h2>
<h2>If it does indeed get blocked by the schools wifi</h2>
<h2>i shall simply create another one.</h2>
<h2>the owner will remain anonyoums for the time being and i will try to be as active as much as I can.</h2>
<b>how and what you use this website is entirely your decision and the owner does not take responsibility for the actions you do on here or at school.</b>
<h2>GO DOWN FOR THE DESIGNING PROCESS!!!!!</h2>
<h2>Wells Im not good at designing websites since this is my first time doing so...</h2>
<h2>I want to hear some feedback and some critisem for the website so i can later update it.</h2>
<h2>I liked darkmode simple, and magjority of people do so too!</h2>
<h2>but some idiots stick to the light. </h2>
<h2>I took away the option for light mode only pitch black.</h2>
<h2>if your argue about that to me i will feel free to not give a shit about it.</h2>
<h2>Please note that im trying to save your eyes. I am in no way shape or form trying to damage them further.</h2>
<h2>talking about damaging eyes i designed the website to be as safe for the eye as possible(While sticking to a decent design.)</h2>
<h2>I am writing this half way until the site is finish. </h2>
<h2>I do belive to have atleast 1-10 people but i will wait and hold for my expectations.</h2>
<b>END/CONTINUED DESIGNING OF THE WEBSITE.</b>
